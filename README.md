# odin-recipes

The [Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) project is the first in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about). This project is a simple website developed using HTML, which allows users to navigate to different recipes. CSS will also be used at a later stage.
