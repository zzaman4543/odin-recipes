# odin-recipes

The [Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) project is the first in the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about). This project is a simple website developed using HTML, which allows users to navigate to different recipes. CSS will also be used at a later stage. 

After completing the HTML part of this project, I have displayed the following skills: an ability to use boilerplate HTML, heading elements, relative links through anchor elements, absolute paths through image elements, paragraph elements, unordered and ordered list elements, as well as div elements.

Having completed the CSS part of this project, I have demonstrated these skills: an ability to use external CSS, class selectors, universal selectors, type selectors, the background-color property, the color property, the font-family property, the text-align property, the font-size property, the height property, the width property, the box-sizing property, the margin property, the padding property, the border property, and the display property.
